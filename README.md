## The User Profile - Checkin History

- Have you ever gone to a great playground that you forget where it was?
- Maybe you can't seem to remember if there are restrooms at that one playground.
- Or maybe it is really hot outside and you need to really make sure that the playground DID have a water feature!

As a user, you will be able to checkin to any playground you visit. These checkins are tracked and logged in your history browser, making it incredibly easy to view past playground experiences. With the added feature of ratings and comments, you can quickly find the one experience that was a 5 star blast and stay away from that 1 star yikes!

- How are you going to have a useful checkin history if you don't log that playground visit?

The checkin feature for users is quick and easy. Simply find your park, give it a rating, and leave a comment about your experience. Don't remember if there were restrooms? No sweat, we got you covered! We know plenty of details on our playgrounds, including stuff like what neighborhood that playground was in. Remember, you are giving your EXPEREIENCE a rating! This means that one playground can have a wildly different rating depending on your experience.

There are TONS of playgrounds in this concrete jungle. If you happen to find one that we did not include in our list, please feel free to add it! We appreciate your help in developing the most comprehensive list of playgrounds for all families. We like to include images with our playgrounds, but if you did not happen to take a picture of your great discovery, we've got your back with our default picture.

## The User Profile - Suggestions

Lastly, our users get the added perk of seeing checkins from other users. Why would you want to see another users checkin? Well, maybe you are looking to go to a certain playground that looks good on paper. It may be beneficial to see what other people are saying about this "looks good on paper" playground!! There are also those times where you might want to see if other people also had a bad experience at the playground. It is all to easy to get the confirmation! Or what about the situation when you don't have a clue which playground you want to go to, but you know you want to check out something new? There is a suggestion for that!

## Conclusion

We know that having kids is hard. We know that going to the playground, though an enjoyable experience, can be hard. We know that sometimes it feels lonely and confusing to be a caregiver.

Our ultimate goal is to make the experience of going to the playground a little easier and a little less lonely. We want to provide a detailed directory of information, as well as a network of likeminded individuals, to what is otherwise an underserved part of our community.
